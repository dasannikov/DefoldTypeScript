## Code Generation
Using TypeScript you get strong type check, typed arguments, classes, inheritance and more. All reflects to Lua basic constructions. TS to Lua work the same way as TS to JS. Very useful for big projects development. Generated Lua code is very clean and human readable. 

## TODO
- (DONE) Auto generate `defold.d.ts` file with full Defold support.
- (DONE) Add types to function's arguments where it's possible
- Further development of [TypeScript to Lua Transpiler](https://github.com/Perryvw/TypescriptToLua)
- Add build system (Currently, for test purposes, it's just shell script)
